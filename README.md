### Hi everyone! Here you can find helpful resources while you work on the projects and labs throughout the Fall 2025 semester. If you are still needing help, my office hours will be on Mondays from 12-3 pm in Sennott Square 6508. If this time does not work for you, please reach out and we can find a time that works best for you to answer any questions you may have. My email is LUC59@pitt.edu
