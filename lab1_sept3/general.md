### Helpful terminal commands

* To make a new folder:
  * ```mkdir folder_name```
* To see your current file path (your breadcrumbs basically):
  * ```pwd```
  *   This will return something like ```/ihome/cmpinf0010_2025f/your_pitt_id/```
* To get out of a folder:
  * ```cd ..```
  * If I have a file path like ```/home/school/work/``` and I want to get to my school folder, I would do ```cd ..```
  * If you want to get out of multiple directories (folders) you can do:
    * ```cd ../../```
    * By adding an extra ```/../``` to ```cd ..``` you are going out of not just one folder, but two
* To see the contents of a folder:
  * ```ls```
* To delete a file/folder:
  * ```rm file_or_folder_name```
  * If you get a message like "failed to remove 'Intro-to-Jupyter/': Directory not empty" try ```rm -rf file_or_folder_name```
* Can't remember a command you used?:
  * ```Ctrl+R```
  * After this, try typing in as much as you remember, this will search your previous commands
* Want to reuse your previous command?:
  * Just press the up arrow to reuse it
* Want to cancel the current command without having to do backspace?:
  * ```Ctrl+C```
* Want to clean up your terminal screen?:
  * ```clear```
  * This will not delete the previous commands, they just will not be visisbile
  * If you would like to see your previous commands, just scroll up
